# PO-SLAM
This repo proposes a SAM-augmented target-oriented SLAM framework that enables planetary rovers to identify target, estimate the relative position, and reconstruct/represent the target from abstraction to precision. This object SLAM algorithms can work in an unstructured, weakly textured, and lunar terrain environment.
